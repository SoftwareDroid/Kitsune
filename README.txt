Kitsune is a program designed to help with learning Japanese.
It converts a subtitle file (srt) for an anime into a format suitable for reading and learning.
In doing so, furigana are added in parentheses (and no kanji to learn).
Spaces are added between words to make it easier to recognize words.
Added an automatic translation into e.g. English.
As well as in a separate file a list by looked up words in the subtitles in a dictionary.
This list also contains references to the first file.

The settings can be in the config.toml.
